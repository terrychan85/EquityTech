# IncidentApiTaskA - API Testing & Sample Inputs/Outputs

Swagger UI was added so you can easily test and explore the Incident API directly from your browser, without needing extra tools.

When you run the project (`dotnet run`), just open the application URL (e.g., http://localhost:5148) and youâ€™ll see an interactive homepage where you can try out all API endpoints and view live documentation.
