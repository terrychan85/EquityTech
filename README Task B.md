# Incident List Rendering: Common Issues & Solutions

This guide summarizes what could go wrong when rendering a dynamic incident list with severity-based styling in Razor, and how to fix each issue.

---

## 1. Background Color Not Showing on Table Rows
- **Problem:** Applying a CSS class with `background-color` to `<tr>` may not work in all browsers.
- **Fix:** Apply the class to each `<td>` instead of `<tr>`, as most browsers reliably render background color on table cells.

---

## 2. List Not Updating Dynamically
- **Problem:** If the incident list is not updated on the server or not rebound to the view, new or removed incidents won’t appear.
- **Fix:** Ensure the data source (`Model.Incidents`) is updated and the page is refreshed (or, in Blazor, that state changes trigger a re-render).

---

## 3. Incorrect or Missing CSS Classes
- **Problem:** If the severity value is misspelled or the CSS class is not defined, no styling will be applied.
- **Fix:** Validate severity values and ensure all possible classes (`severity-low`, `severity-medium`, `severity-high`) are defined in your CSS.

---

## 4. Null or Empty Data
- **Problem:** If the incident list is null or empty, the table may render with no rows or throw an error.
- **Fix:** Initialize the list in the page model and optionally show a “No incidents found” message if the list is empty.
